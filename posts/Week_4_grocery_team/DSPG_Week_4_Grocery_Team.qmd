# Project Overview

# Work completed

-   Reviewing the client reports understanding the key aspects of the project

-   Collecting and Evaluating the various possible data sources

    ![](images/Data%20Sources.png)

-   Client meeting to share our insights and get more clarity on their expectations from the project

        Key insights from the meeting:

        -   We clarified the scope of the project and determined a path for moving forwards.

        -   We learned about existing data sources, such as Bizminer and VerticalIQ, and learned more about the rural grocery business

-   Understanding and documenting the function from the excel

-   Learnt documentation using R oxygen

-   Recreating the Excel functions in R

Our goal for this week was to create a package that has all the required functions.Many functions that we created were inter-related i.e., it required the output of some other function as its input.

### Alex

-   Created functions Estimating the Market size

-   Here is the code for one of the functions in that calculation:

    The function Pct_County is used to calculate the percentage of the county under the proposed store.

```{r}

Pct_County <- function(north_quad,east_quad,south_quad,west_quad, county_size) {
  sum_val <- sum(Quadrant_Area(north_quad),Quadrant_Area(east_quad),
                 Quadrant_Area(south_quad),Quadrant_Area(west_quad))
  return(sum_val / county_size)
}
```

### Srika

-   Created functions Estimating the Total Revenue

-   Here is the code for one of the functions in that calculation:

    The function Primary_Shopper_Count estimates the number of primary shopper from the different categories of markets like Metro,rural and towns nearby for the proposed store

    ```{r}
    Primary_Shopper_Count<-function(pct_metro_prim=50,pct_rural_prim=30
                                    ,pct_town_prim=30,county_pop, towns_pop,
                                    pct_county,metro_list,town_list){
      rural_pop<-Rural_Population(county_pop, towns_pop, pct_county)
      metro_pop<-City_Populations(metro_list)
      town_pop<-City_Populations(town_list)
      (metro_pop*(pct_metro_prim/100))+(rural_pop*(pct_rural_prim/100))+
        (town_pop*(pct_town_prim/100))
    }
    ```

### Aaron

-   Created functions Estimating the Expenses

-   Here is the code for one of the functions in that calculation:

    The function Employee_Wages calculates the dollars spent on employee wages.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}

    Employee_Wages <- function(Total_Estimated_Revenue) {

      ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue < 500000, stop("error: no data for this revenue range"),
             percentage <- ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue < 999999.99, .0789,
                                  ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue < 2499999.99, .0934,
                                         ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue < 4999999.99, .0751,
                                                ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue < 24999999.99, .0975, .1083)))))



      Total_Estimated_Revenue * percentage
    }
    ```

# Work in Progress

-   Ideas for optimizing and automation of the functions

# Plan for completion

This flow chart will help us follow the required throughout the project and map its use.
