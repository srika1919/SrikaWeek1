> The above chart shows our plan for the next few week to successfully complete this project!

# Training and Data Discovery

-   Data camp training on fundamentals of R and Tableau

-   Reviewed:

    -   Ownership models

    -   Status of the grocery industry

    -   The margin for different categories of products in a grocery store

    -   Trends in the market

    -   Suppliers and distributors

    -   Support for rural grocery store setup

-   Reviewing the client reports understanding the key aspects of the project:

    -   Market share - Calculates how many potential customers a store in a specific location would bring in.

    -   Estimating the Revenue - Calculates the total revenue of the store.

    -   Estimating Expenses - Calculating the various expenses of the store by revenue range.

-   Learned documentation using R oxygen.

Collecting and Evaluating the various possible data sources

# Client Meeting

We had a meeting with our client where we shared our insights and got more clarity on their expectations from the project.

We shared the data that we collected during the first three weeks.

Key insights from the meeting:

-   We clarified the scope of the project and determined a path for moving forwards.

-   We learned about existing data sources, such as Bizminer and VerticalIQ, and learned more about the rural grocery business

# Creating Functions

This week was primarily focused on understanding and documenting the function from our client's Excel sheets.

-   Recreating the Excel functions in R.

-   Using Roxygen2 to provide documentation for the functions.

-   Preparing to build the DSPG Grocery package.

### Alex

-   Created functions Estimating the Market size

-   Here is the code for one of the functions in that calculation:

    The function Pct_County is used to calculate the percentage of the county under the proposed store.

```{r}

Pct_County <- function(north_quad,east_quad,south_quad,west_quad, county_size) {
  sum_val <- sum(Quadrant_Area(north_quad),Quadrant_Area(east_quad),
                 Quadrant_Area(south_quad),Quadrant_Area(west_quad))
  return(sum_val / county_size)
}
```

### Srika

-   Created functions Estimating the Total Revenue

-   Here is the code for one of the functions in that calculation:

    The function Primary_Shopper_Count estimates the number of primary shopper from the different categories of markets like Metro,rural and towns nearby for the proposed store

    ```{r}
    Primary_Shopper_Count<-function(pct_metro_prim=50,pct_rural_prim=30
                                    ,pct_town_prim=30,county_pop, towns_pop,
                                    pct_county,metro_list,town_list){
      rural_pop<-Rural_Population(county_pop, towns_pop, pct_county)
      metro_pop<-City_Populations(metro_list)
      town_pop<-City_Populations(town_list)
      (metro_pop*(pct_metro_prim/100))+(rural_pop*(pct_rural_prim/100))+
        (town_pop*(pct_town_prim/100))
    }
    ```

### Aaron

-   Created functions Estimating the Expenses

-   Here is the code for one of the functions in that calculation:

    The function Employee_Wages calculates the dollars spent on employee wages.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}

    Employee_Wages <- function(Total_Estimated_Revenue) {

      ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue < 500000, stop("error: no data for this revenue range"),
             percentage <- ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue < 999999.99, .0789,
                                  ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue < 2499999.99, .0934,
                                         ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue < 4999999.99, .0751,
                                                ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue < 24999999.99, .0975, .1083)))))



      Total_Estimated_Revenue * percentage
    }
    ```

# Work in Progress

We are continuing to optimize functions further and are looking into different ways to automate data retrieval, including Google Maps integration to display regions where a proposed location would be the nearest grocery store
