Our major task for this week was to create functions and document them. We also created a flow chart to understand the dependencies for the various functions from the user input or from the other functions.

# Created Functions

I learned to create functions in R. Then I recreated all required functions to calculate Revenue from the client-shared Excel Sheet. Functions Created:

-    Avg_Capita_Grocery_Spending() 

-   Adj_Capita_Grocery_Spend() 

-   State_Adj_Capita_Grocery_Spend() 

-   Primary_Shoppers_Count() 

-   Secondary_Shoppers_Count() 

-   Rare_Shoppers_Count() 

-   Total_Spend_Primary_Shoppers() 

-   Total_Spend_Secondary_Shoppers() 

-   Total_Spend_Rare_Shoppers()

-   Total_Estimate_Revenue() 

# Documenting Functions

This week I learned how to use the Roxygen package to document the functions created in R.

# Flow Chart

After my teammates and I created our functions, we created a flow chart that helped us visualize where the functions are getting dependent on each other.

# Guest Presentation

On Friday, we had a Guest from Oklahoma State University visiting us. So we did a Recap of work done so far and we presented that to him.
