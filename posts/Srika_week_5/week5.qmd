The major task of this week was to test run the functions created last week. I also found possible sources to get the state index and Percentage price increase, 2 parameters we were unsure of from the previous work. I also went to the GIS conference in Des Moines on Thursday.

# Testing Functions

I used the sample case given in the client's Excel to test the functions. Corrected some functions and floored some output values to give a better estimate.

# Visualizations of the dollar store Data

I got data from 2 different sources. I created visualizations about the distribution of the different dollar store chains using Plotly in R.

> The above plot shows the cities in Iowa with more than 1 dollar store. Des Moines, as expected, has the highest number of dollar stores.

# Coffee Talk

This week on Wednesday, I did a coffee talk about the YouTube Studio Analysis. As a YouTube content creator, spending time looking at the various analytics is interesting and insightful. I shared with the DSPG team about the various analytics I could look at in the YouTube Studio and how this data-driven approach enables me to create content that resonates with their target audience, leading to increased engagement and growth on the platform.

# Client Meeting

We had a Client meeting in the afternoon. I got the opportunity to clarify my doubts regarding percentage price increase and State index, the 2 variables that were confusing for me in the Estimating Revenue sheet shared by the Client. When I showed the sources I got, he reviewed them and clarified that the Consumer price index could be used as the percent price increase and Regional price parities as the State index. I also clarified the 2 different methods he used to calculate the Avg per capita grocery spending in the US. This meeting was very useful in proceeding forward with the project.

# GIS Conference

On Thursday, we went to the GIS conference in Des Moines. I attended the following presentations there "Modernizing Arc GIS Web App Builder Apps Using Experience Builder", "Introduction to R Programming", and "The Story of Waters at the Missouri DOC and the new hydrography and wetland modeling". I liked the Intro to R presentation, and I liked the others too, but they were overwhelming for me as it was designed for mostly GIS professionals.
