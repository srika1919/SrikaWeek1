# General Overview

I printed my first "Hello World! " in R this week! started learning about the general syntax for the various operations in R. Learning both R in general and data analysis parts of R. I am also exploring how to make my blogs look better, like adding pictures, headings, bolding, adding code blocks, etc.

# Analyzed some ACS data using Tidyverse in R

Tried to find the percentage of people with graduate level of education in different Counties of Iowa

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
library(tidycensus)

vars <- load_variables(2021, "acs5")

grad_education<- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  variables = "DP02_0066P",
  year = 2021,
  survey = "acs1" #<<
)

library(tidyverse)

arrange(grad_education,estimate)
arrange(grad_education,desc(estimate))

grad_education_Iowa <- grad_education%>%
  separate(NAME, into = c("county", "state"), sep = ", ") %>%
  filter(state == "Iowa") %>%
  arrange(desc(estimate))
  
ggplot(grad_education_Iowa, aes(x = estimate, 
                                 y = reorder(county, estimate))) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = estimate - moe, xmax = estimate + moe),
                width = 0.5, linewidth = 0.5) +
labs(title = "% Graduate level education for different counties in Iowa",
     x = "ACS estimate in %",
     y = "")+
  geom_point(size = 1)

library(plotly)
ggplotly(tooltip = "x")

```
