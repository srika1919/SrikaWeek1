    "text": "The major task of this week was to test run the functions created last week. I also found possible sources to get the state index and Percentage price increase, 2 parameters we were unsure of from the previous work. I also went to the GIS conference in Des Moines on Thursday.\n\nTesting Functions\nI used the sample case given in the client’s Excel to test the functions. Corrected some functions and floored some output values to give a better estimate.\n\n\nVisualizations of the dollar store Data\nI got data from 2 different sources. I created visualizations about the distribution of the different dollar store chains using Plotly in R.\n\n\nThe above plot shows the location sales volume ranges for different dollar store chains in Iowa, like Dollar Tree, Dollar General, and Family Dollar Store.\n\n\n\nThe above plot shows the cities in Iowa with more than 1 dollar store. Des Moines, as expected, has the highest number of dollar stores.\n\n\n\nCoffee Talk\nThis week on Wednesday, I did a coffee talk about the YouTube Studio Analysis. As a YouTube content creator, spending time looking at the various analytics is interesting and insightful. I shared with the DSPG team about the various analytics I could look at in the YouTube Studio and how this data-driven approach enables me to create content that resonates with their target audience, leading to increased engagement and growth on the platform.\n\n\nClient Meeting\n\nWe had a Client meeting in the afternoon. I got the opportunity to clarify my doubts regarding percentage price increase and State index, the 2 variables that were confusing for me in the Estimating Revenue sheet shared by the Client. When I showed the sources I got, he reviewed them and clarified that the Consumer price index could be used as the percent price increase and Regional price parities as the State index. I also clarified the 2 different methods he used to calculate the Avg per capita grocery spending in the US. This meeting was very useful in proceeding forward with the project.\n\n\nGIS Conference\nOn Thursday, we went to the GIS conference in Des Moines. I attended the following presentations there “Modernizing Arc GIS Web App Builder Apps Using Experience Builder”, “Introduction to R Programming”, and “The Story of Waters at the Missouri DOC and the new hydrography and wetland modeling”. I liked the Intro to R presentation, and I liked the others too, but they were overwhelming for me as it was designed for mostly GIS professionals."

    "text": "Project Overview\nOur group’s task in the 2023 DSPG program is to develop a tool for the Farm, Food and Enterprise Development ISU Extension (FFED) that can help inform decision making for rural grocery stores. The goal of the project is to help users to make better decisions in opening, inheriting, and operating grocery stores in rural environments. The development of the tool relies heavily on the research conducted by domain experts on rural grocery stores and accessibility to verified data on the topic. Our current workflow moving forward is outlined in the following manner.\n\n\n\nWeekly Project Timeline\n\n\nAs we learn more about our data and possibilities for automating processes that our client’s initially calculated manually, we update our vision for what our final deliverable for DSPG could be. A draft of our thoughts are depicted as a tool which takes a certain range of user input and automated data, transforms that data through converted functions, and outputs the results in the most accessible format for the user.\n\n\n\nTool Processes"

    "text": "Our major task for this week was to create functions and document them. We also created a flow chart to understand the dependencies for the various functions from the user input or from the other functions.\n\nCreated Functions\nI learned to create functions in R. Then I recreated all required functions to calculate Revenue from the client-shared Excel Sheet. Functions Created:\n\nAvg_Capita_Grocery_Spending() \nAdj_Capita_Grocery_Spend() \nState_Adj_Capita_Grocery_Spend() \nPrimary_Shoppers_Count() \nSecondary_Shoppers_Count() \nRare_Shoppers_Count() \nTotal_Spend_Primary_Shoppers() \nTotal_Spend_Secondary_Shoppers() \nTotal_Spend_Rare_Shoppers()\nTotal_Estimate_Revenue() \n\n\n\nDocumenting Functions\nThis week I learned how to use the Roxygen package to document the functions created in R.\n\n\n\nFlow Chart\nAfter my teammates and I created our functions, we created a flow chart that helped us visualize where the functions are getting dependent on each other.\n\n\n\nGuest Presentation\nOn Friday, we had a Guest from Oklahoma State University visiting us. So we did a Recap of work done so far and we presented that to him."

    "text": "For the first 2 days of this week, we collected data for the WINVEST project. My major task for this week was creating plots using the grocery store and dollar store data from Sales Genie.\n\nVisualizations\nThe following plots show the distribution of stores in cities of Iowa with more than one chain grocery store and non-chain grocery store, respectively. I am currently working on improving this plot by trying to make a single plot that contains the distribution of the stores color-coded by the type so that we can see if there are any trends that we can observe about the presence of one type of store affecting the other(like if dollar stores affect the non-chain grocery stores).\n\n\nFrom all these plots, one common thing that we can observe is that irrespective of the type, there are usually more stores in big cities than in small cities, as we would expect.\n\nThe above plot shows the distribution of the number of stores by Sales volumes for the major chain grocery stores in Iowa. I must do data cleaning and arrange the x-axis titles in ascending order to make them more interpretable.\n\nThe plot shows the location sales volume for the non-chain grocery stores. We can see that many of the non-chain grocery stores have a 1-2.5 Million sales volume."

    "text": "Function Recreation\nWe wanted to start with recreating the functions from Excel into an R package so that we could think about automation and edition later. I worked on the Market Revenue calculations sheet, which was highly dependent on the output from the Market Size Calculations Sheet. So initially, to visualize the flow, I created a flow chart using Miro to map how the functions are linked. I set some default percentages for the share by the primary, secondary, and rare shoppers to the total market revenue, which the user can alter if they want to.\n\n\nDifficulty in the process\nFiguring out the State index and percentage price increase values took a lot of my time after I created the functions. I shortlisted some of the resources that I found can be useful, like the CPI(Consumer Price Index), PPI(Producer Price Index), RPP(Rural Price Parities), and Cost of Living index. What made it more confusing for me was that some of these had values specifically for groceries other than the overall value. After discussing with Duane(our client) in our last meeting, I chose to use the Consumer Price index, which is the measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services, as the estimated price increase, and use Rural Price Parities, which measure the differences in price levels across states and metropolitan areas for a given year and are expressed as a percentage of the overall national price level, as the State Index.\\\n\n\nUpdate and Maintenance\nI created the following table to Track the source and links about the variables used and how frequently it is required to be updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable name\nFrequency\nSource\nLink\nNotes\n\n\nTotal US Grocery Sales\nOptional\nIBIS\n\nDefault base year taken as 2022\n\n\nTotal US population\nOptional\nUS Census Bureau\n\nDefault base year taken as 2022\n\n\nEstimated cumulative price increase(CPI)\nyearly update/ Half yearly update\nUS Bureau of labor statistics\nhttps://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SA0\nCPI in current year - CPI in base year\nFor now defaulting as 7 for 2023\n\n\nState Index\nyearly update\nBEA\nhttps://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=70&step=1&acrdn=8#eyJhcHBpZCI6NzAsInN0ZXBzIjpbMSwyNCwyOSwyNSwzMSwyNiwyNywzMF0sImRhdGEiOltbIlRhYmxlSWQiLCIxMDEiXSxbIkNsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9uIiwiTm9uLUluZHVzdHJ5Il0sWyJNYWpvcl9BcmVhIiwiMCJdLFsiU3RhdGUiLFsiMCJdXSxbIkFyZWEiLFsiWFgiXV0sWyJTdGF0aXN0aWMiLFsiMSJdXSxbIlVuaXRfb2ZfbWVhc3VyZSIsIkxldmVscyJdLFsiWWVhciIsWyItMSJdXSxbIlllYXJCZWdpbiIsIi0xIl0sWyJZZWFyX0VuZCIsIi0xIl1dfQ==\n\n\n\n\nThe consumer Price index is updated every month, but it is fine to take yearly once or twice because it does change each month very much. And for the Rural Price parities, the latest data that we have is 2021 because it is economic census data and is not available for the recent 1 year."
